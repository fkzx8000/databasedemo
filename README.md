# Data Games - Interactive Learning for Database Concepts

Welcome to **Data Games**, a modest project built to help visualize and understand fundamental concepts in databases and data normalization through interactive games. This project isn't aiming to be a comprehensive course, but rather a playful and engaging supplement for anyone looking to grasp these important topics in a more hands-on way.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We chose React for its component-based architecture which makes building interactive and dynamic UIs a breeze.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. TypeScript helps us write more maintainable and robust code, especially as the project grows with more games and features.
- **Framer Motion**: A powerful animation and gesture library for React. Framer Motion allows us to create smooth, engaging, and visually appealing game interactions, making the learning experience more enjoyable.

## Features

This project currently includes a collection of games designed to illustrate various aspects of databases and normalization:

- **Normalization Puzzles**: Interactive puzzles that guide you through the process of normalizing data tables step-by-step. You'll learn to identify data redundancy and apply normalization rules (like 1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to improve database design.
- **Relationship Builders**: Games focused on understanding different types of relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). These games will help you visualize how tables connect and interact in a relational database.
- **Query Challenges**: Simple challenges that introduce basic SQL query concepts. You'll get a chance to construct simple queries to retrieve data and understand how queries interact with databases.
- **(More Games Coming Soon\!)**: We are continually working on adding more games to cover a broader range of database and data-related concepts. Stay tuned for updates\!

The goal of these games is not to replace formal learning but to offer a different angle of approach. We believe that interacting with these concepts through games can make the learning process more intuitive and less intimidating, especially for those new to databases.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fkzx8000/databasedemo
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd databasedemo
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or if you are using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate through the different games from the main menu. Each game has its own set of instructions which are usually provided within the game itself. We tried to make the games as intuitive as possible, but feel free to experiment and explore.

The games are designed to be played in any order, although starting with the "Normalization Puzzles" might provide a good foundation if you are completely new to database normalization.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions\! If you have ideas for new games, improvements to existing games, or bug fixes, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

When contributing, please try to maintain the modest and educational spirit of the project. Any contributions that enhance the learning experience or expand the range of concepts covered are highly appreciated.
